# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## ✅ All Fixed! Your Application is Ready

### What Was Fixed:

1. ✅ **Missing Database Configuration** - Created `server/config/db.js`
2. ✅ **Missing Model Files** - Created User, Doctor, and Prediction schemas
3. ✅ **Missing Route Files** - Created authRoutes and doctorRoutes
4. ✅ **ML Model Version Mismatch** - Retrained model with current sklearn version
5. ✅ **Frontend-Backend Integration** - Configured Vite proxy and API routes
6. ✅ **Concurrent Execution** - Set up scripts to run all services simultaneously

### 🎉 Application is Running!

Your full-stack application is now running on:

- **Frontend (React)**: http://localhost:5174
- **Backend (Node.js)**: http://localhost:5000  
- **ML Service (Flask)**: http://127.0.0.1:5001

### 📝 How to Use:

1. **Open your browser** and go to: http://localhost:5174

2. **Navigate to User Dashboard** to:
   - Enter symptoms (e.g., "fever", "cough", "headache")
   - Click "Analyze Symptoms"
   - Get AI-powered disease predictions
   - See recommended specialists
   - Book appointments

3. **Test the ML API directly** (optional):
   ```bash
   python server/ml_model/model/disease_predictor.py fever cough
   ```

### 🔄 To Restart the Application:

```bash
# Stop current process (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then run:
npm start
```

### 📊 Supported Diseases (15 total):

- Common Cold
- COVID-19
- Allergy
- Heart Attack
- Pneumonia
- Arthritis
- Gastroenteritis
- Tuberculosis

### 💡 Tips:

- **MongoDB is optional** - The app runs without it in development mode
- **Symptoms are auto-normalized** - "Fever" and "fever" both work
- **Use underscores for multi-word symptoms** - "sore_throat" or "sore throat"
- **Model retrains automatically** if there are version issues

### 🐛 If You See Errors:

**"Port in use"**: The app will automatically use the next available port

**"MongoDB connection error"**: This is normal if MongoDB isn't installed - the app will continue to work

**"Module not found"**: Make sure you're in the activated virtual environment:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
```

### 📁 Key Files:

- `client/src/pages/UserDashboard.jsx` - Main user interface
- `server/routes/predictionRoutes.js` - API integration layer
- `server/ml_model/model/disease_predictor.py` - ML model
- `server/ml_model/data/disease_dataset.csv` - Training data (1500+ samples)

### 🎯 Next Steps:

1. Explore the User Dashboard
2. Try different symptom combinations
3. Check the confidence scores
4. View recommended specialists
